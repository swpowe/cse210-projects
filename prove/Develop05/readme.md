Status: 

Monday 20th. 
- reverted changes.
- Working with simple goals only except not reloading status
- worked to modify but then it didn't read back in the status?

Tuesday 21st.
x- hit a snag with completing a task. Perhaps need to turn that into a class method
x- can't currently tally extra points for checklist item

- Checklist number completed out of isn't getting loaded
- might need to create actual objects when I record event? 

Wednesday 22nd
- I think it's fixed. Needs more testing and cleanup
x loading goals doesn't load the x/2 completed for Checklist
    - i think i'm not saving or restoring the completed_times that's why
- the main X does restore
